# Autonomous_Car

INSTALLATION OF NECESSARY LIBERARIES AND SOFTWARES FOR RUNNING THIS PROGRAM

So first we need to install certain libraries so that our project can run on respective computer this is
because in order to run a machine learning algorithm we need some libraries pre-installed like tensor-
flow, kears, sklearn, pandas etc. with help of these libraries you can run almost all ML algorithms
We also need to install udacity self-driving simulator which will be provided in the cd.

Step 1 - Install python version 3.6 from https://www.python.org/downloads/

Step 2 - Install mini-conda from https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html

Step 3 - Download and install Udacity Self-driving Car simulator from https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim

Step 4 – Install the following libraries in anaconda command prompt:

            conda install -y scipy
            pip install --exists-action i --upgrade sklearn
            pip install --exists-action i --upgrade pandas
            pip install --exists-action i --upgrade pandas-datareader
            pip install --exists-action i --upgrade matplotlib
            pip install --exists-action i --upgrade pillow
            pip install --exists-action i --upgrade tqdm
            pip install --exists-action i --upgrade requests
            pip install --exists-action i --upgrade h5py
            pip install --exists-action i --upgrade pyyaml
            pip install --exists-action i --upgrade tensorflow_hub
            pip install --exists-action i --upgrade bayesian-optimization
            pip install --exists-action i --upgrade spacy
            pip install --exists-action i --upgrade gensim
            pip install --exists-action i --upgrade flask
            pip install --exists-action i --upgrade boto3
            pip install --exists-action i --upgrade gym
            pip install --exists-action i --upgrade tensorflow==2.0.0-beta1
            pip install --exists-action i --upgrade keras-rl2 –user

Step 5 – Open jupyter notebook with the following command in anaconda command prompt:

            jupyter notebook

Step 6 – locate the drive.py file and cd and select the kernel to (python 3.6 tensor-flow)
And run the commands with (shift + enter)

Step 7 – Open udacity selfdriving program given in the cd and hit autonomous mode
